      1. Review file changes for modified GraphQL operations
      2. If a GraphQL operation was modified or removed, add a suggestion to including error handling and fallback behavior for when the GraphQL operation or field is unavailable in certain conditions. Ask the author if the following is applicable:
         - Does the operation use fields available only to Enterprise Edition users?
         - Which GitLab release was the field introduced in?
         - What feature flags should be checked before attempting the operation?
      3. Skip sending unsupported operations when fallback behavior can be provided.
      4. Omit unsupported fields when submitting GraphQL operations.
      5. Does not introduce an excessive number of requests each time the operation is invoked.
      6. Add new test coverage which addresses the expected questions, based on the answers to these questions.
